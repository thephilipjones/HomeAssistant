# Home Assistant configuration

This is the live working configuration of my Smart Home.

## System

A Raspberry Pi server is the controller. It runs:

* Home Assistant
* Homebridge
* Unifi Controller

A Synology NAS is the backbone. It runs:

* VPN Server
* Plex
* Time Machine backups

## Bridges

This requires a few extra hubs/bridges:

* Philips Hue Bridge
* Linear HUSBZB-1 Z-Wave + Zigbee hub
* August Connect
* Harmony Hub

## Control

Several methods of accessing these features include:

* Downstairs Echo - Alexa
* Bedroom Echo - Alexa
* Downstairs iPad Mini - Apple Home / Hue / Spotify

## Network

I'm all in on UniFi. I have:

* UniFi Security Gateway - router
* UniFi US-8-60W - core NOC switch
* UniFi US-8-60W - main floor switch
* UniFi AP-AC-Pro - main floor wifi
* Motorola MoCA adapters - connect NOC to main floor
* Apple Airport Extreme / 2TB Time Capsule - Time Machine backups
* Apple Airport Extreme / old version - NOC device switch
* ASUS RT-66U - VPN client: switch + 2.4GHz wifi

## Climate

This old house is not ideal but at least I know where the cold spots are:

* Nest Thermostat - main floor
* Zooz 4-in-1 sensor - main floor
* Zooz 4-in-1 sensor - bedroom
* Zooz plug controlling main floor humidifier

## Media

This is mostly an Apple household but we have a little variety:

* Harmony Hub - living room
* Apple TV 4k - living room
* Apple TV 4th gen - bedroom
* Apple TV 3rd gen - sunroom
* Chromecast - sunroom

## Lights

Oh yeah, we keep the place illuminated as well. The Hue system was actually the first step into this world:

* Philips Hue bulbs, lightstrip, and dimmer - living room
* Philips Hue bulbs and lightstrip - dining room
* Philips Hue lightstrip and Tap switch - kitchen
* Philips Hue bulbs, lightstrip, and motion detector - basement
* Philips Hue bulbs - sunroom
* Philips Hue bulbs and dimmer - bedroom
* LED Christmas lights on a TP-Link HS100 switch - living room
